To address this need, I developed a web application to display current weather data using an API key. 
My goal was to create a user-friendly interface that integrates with a weather API for efficient data retrieval and display. 
I used the following methods:

- Wrote a Python script to request and retrieve weather data from the API.
- Designed an HTML file and applied CSS for a structured and visually appealing layout.
- Used a template engine to integrate the Python script with the HTML, enabling dynamic data display.

The result is a functional web application that shows real-time weather data, utilizing Python, HTML, and CSS. 
This tool is valuable for anyone needing timely and accurate weather information.
